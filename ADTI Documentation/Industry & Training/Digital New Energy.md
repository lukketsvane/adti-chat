## **Introduction**

ABB Renewables has made a world of difference in the energy industry through its relentless pursuit of innovation and speed, all driven by purpose and passion. ABB's core strength lies in its ability to leverage digital technology, operational efficiency, and expert project management teams.

## **The Journey of ABB Renewables**

From 2021 to 2025, the volume of PAEN (Process Automation Energy Industries) in Norway increased by 53%, and the share of renewables grew from 25% to 44%. The compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) stood at 30%. This growth was facilitated by the sales force solutions pipeline, excluding service, from 2022 to 2024.

ABB Renewables operates on a mission to foster market-driven innovation in collaboration with key customers. The focus is on developing value-adding products and solutions that contribute to the energy sector's evolution.

## **Innovations in Subsea Energy Systems**

A notable milestone in ABB's journey is the subsea substation at 300-500MVA, a landmark in the "Deep Purple Pilot" project. This project is an endeavor towards offshore wind-based hydrogen production, pushing the boundaries of electrical system design, automation, and digital technologies.

## **Driving Accountability and Standardizing Offerings**

ABB works with a focus on driving accountability throughout the organization. Sales and operations play pivotal roles in developing new markets, maturing opportunities, and ensuring world-class execution. With an eye for gaining a competitive edge, ABB has standardized its offerings and execution models while promoting effective sales and bidding processes.

## **Commitment to the Energy Transition**

ABB values courage, care, curiosity, and collaboration in its commitment to leading the energy transition. The journey through 2019-2025 showcases the progression from offshore and onshore operations to exploring new market concepts and enhancing service in the power and water segments.

## **Energy Consumption and Transition**

The energy industry has seen two centuries of exponential fossil fuel consumption growth, highlighting modern civilization's dependency on these resources. The dependence on natural gas alone is immense, filling Lake Zurich's volume every eight hours. The challenge ahead is to transition from this overwhelming reliance on fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

## **Timeline of Recent Events**

1. 2020 began with a strategic initiative to electrify the NCS.
2. 2020 - Q2 21 saw an increase in CO2 taxes, offshore wind, and battery-hydrogen-ammonia factories.
3. 2021/22 faced electricity price shocks due to increased CO2 taxes, Russian Gas, and the war in Ukraine. This led to a rise in offshore wind and hybrid-cables, and battery-hydrogen-ammonia factories.
4. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, leading to a shift in energy production towards LNG and maximizing O&G production.
5. In 2022, there was a massive increase in renewable commitment in the EU/UK. The IEA estimated that annual investments by 2030 would be approximately $1000B for O&G and $2000B for renewables, up from $1300B. The Paris agreement requires $4000B in renewables.

## **Looking Forward**

ABB Renewables aims to maximize the value of investment by delivering solutions in various sectors. The successful operation of a plant is about efficient power and process management, areas where ABB shines.

# **SUMMARY**

ABB Renewables, with its innovative approach, has significantly impacted the energy industry. With a substantial increase in renewable energy share, ABB has driven the energy transition forward. Their initiatives range from electrical system design and automation to hydrogen production. Moreover, ABB prioritizes accountability, standardized offerings, and efficient sales processes. They also stay abreast with the international geopolitical landscape, responding strategically to external events affecting energy production and consumption.
