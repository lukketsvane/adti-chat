Last edited time: June 26, 2023 1:01 PM

The first session of the COPA QuickStart training, held on September 1, 2022, was dedicated to providing an executive overview and demonstration of the program.

## QuickStart Overview Lectures

The session began with a detailed introduction, highlighting Equinorâ€™s motivation and goals. An overview of the COPA QuickStart system and training program was presented, followed by a comprehensive demonstration. The participants were also briefed about the instructional lectures and labs planned for the week. They were encouraged to provide feedback to ensure Equinor's needs are being met.

## Case for Action

During the session, several end-user pain points were identified:

1. The lack of interoperability and inability to reuse control applications across systems from different suppliers
2. Excess costs of system upgrades due to the close couplings between components
3. Barriers to the introduction of new technology
4. After-the-fact, bolt-on cybersecurity

The session emphasized the vision of creating a standards-based open, secure, interoperable process automation architecture to address these pain points.

## OPA Reference Architecture

The OPA reference architecture was presented as a contrast to the current proprietary hardware, interfaces, and networks, along with the vendor-controlled software access. The benefits of the OPA architecture, which includes industry-standard interfaces and networks, open software access, and designed-in cybersecurity, were elaborated.

## COPA QuickStart Journey

The evolution of COPA QuickStart, from its inception at ExxonMobil, through the formation of the OPA Forum, the publishing of preliminary standards, and the showcasing of ExxonMobil field trials, to the present COPA QuickStart training, was narrated.

## Coalition for Open Process Automation (COPA)

The Coalition for Open Process Automation's purpose is to catalyze OPA ecosystem and adoption. Organized by CPLANE and CSI, it comprises 14 member companies that span the OPA ecosystem and is independent of the OPA Forum.

## COPA Quickstart Unit

The session provided a detailed rundown of the hardware and software components of the COPA QuickStart unit, including the advanced compute platform, distributed control nodes, and software components from various suppliers.

## COPA QuickStart Demonstration

An elaborate demonstration of the COPA QuickStart unit was carried out during the session, covering various aspects such as I/O to DCN communications, regulatory control, alarms, system management, high-availability, cybersecurity, and fast-cycle economic model predictive control.

## Path to Value

The path to value was defined through QuickStart training and hands-on experience, field trial workshops, a field trial based on O-PAS architecture optimized for a particular process, and a production system.
