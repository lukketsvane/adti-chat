The main objective of WP5 is to define and negotiate a contract for a digital twin pilot application.

### Scope of Work

The following activities will be carried out:

- Identify, approach, and agree on a digital twin customer/partner for ABB digital twin pilot application (20 hours - Core team, 10 hours - Specialists)
- Review customer/partner existing digital projects with ABB and/or digital projects in hand (20 hours - Core team, 10 hours - Specialists)
- Screen customer cases to find a good fit (30 hours - Core team)
- Approach customer through ABB contact, i.e. SAM/GAM (40 hours - Core team, 20 hours - Specialists)

### Deliverables

- Defined list of viable customer cases (after input from WP2)
- Project plan, including the organization for pilot application (Q1-Q2 2024)
- Framework for necessary agreements between pilot project stakeholders (customer and internally)

The results from WP5 will establish a solid foundation for the implementation of ABB's digital twin pilot application. This involves ensuring that all legal and contractual agreements are in place and that the most suitable customer/partner has been identified.
