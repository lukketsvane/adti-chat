# **4. ADTI Phases**

The ABB Digital-Twin Initiative (ADTI) project follows a phased approach, divided into two main stages - the 'Exploration Phase' and the 'Pilot Phase.' Each phase is designed with specific goals in mind, contributing towards the development and implementation of digital twin technologies at ABB.

## **4.1 Exploration Phase (2023)**

The Exploration Phase is a preliminary stage where the foundation for ADTI is laid out. It involves several work packages including:

1. **Project Management (WP0)**: This involves managing the team, reporting to stakeholders, and establishing customer contact and internal ABB management.
2. **Hackathon (WP1)**: Aimed at gathering internal ideas and use cases within the digital twin domain from subject matter experts and trainees.
3. **Establish and Qualify Business Case (WP2)**: It involves market analysis, interviewing peers and customers, reviewing existing digital twin solutions, and scoping out pathways and requirements for different placements for ABB in the digital twin landscape.
4. **Competence Gaps and Requirements (WP4)**: This includes creating frameworks for workstreams, data collection, identifying potential acquisitions, strategic competence acquirement, and choosing technology and partnerships for the first implementation.
5. **Customer Case (WP5)**: This involves customer contact, scheduling, organization, setting contract structures, integrity, legal, market allocation, IP handling, etc.

## **4.2 Pilot Phase (2024)**

Following the Exploration Phase is the Pilot Phase which is aimed at creating a customer pilot application based on the insights and results gathered during the Exploration Phase.

1. **Pilot Application (WP5)**: This involves implementing a pilot application based on the selected case, chosen tools, and the established framework. The aim is to demonstrate the value proposition in a real-life scenario.
2. **Review and Way Forward (WP6)**: This involves reviewing the pilot application, suggesting the way forward based on the work in previous work packages, and finalizing the financing and business plan.
