The digital twin journey is an important initiative aimed at advancing the capabilities and applications of digital twin technology. In this article, we will focus on the exploration phase of the journey, which encompasses the period of Q3-4 2023. Let's dive into the key aspects of this phase.

## Work Packages

During the exploration phase, several work packages were undertaken to establish and qualify the business case for digital twin implementation. Here are the main work packages that were carried out:

### WP1/2: Establish and Qualify Business Case

The first work package focused on establishing and qualifying the business case for implementing digital twin technology. This involved conducting market analysis, interviewing peers and customer groups, and reviewing existing digital twin solutions. The aim was to understand the potential revenue streams and determine the scope and requirements for different placements of ABB in the digital twin landscape.

### WP1: Hackathon & Value Proposition

Within the larger work package, a hackathon and value proposition activity took place. The objective was to gather internal ideas and use cases within the digital twin domain from subject matter experts and trainees. This event allowed for the exploration of innovative concepts and the identification of potential digital twin applications.

### WP2: Develop and Qualify Business Case

The second work package focused on further developing and qualifying the business case. This involved input and review from specialists and account managers, as well as exploring external resources and tools. The goal was to refine the business case and ensure its alignment with market demands and potential revenue opportunities.

### WP4: Competence Gaps and Requirements

The competence gaps and requirements work package aimed to address the necessary skills and knowledge required for successful digital twin implementation. This included creating frameworks for workstreams and data collection, identifying potential acquisitions, and selecting technology and partnerships for the first implementation. The work package also provided the design basis for a pilot application.

### WP5: Customer Case

The customer case work package focused on engaging with customers and establishing a framework for future steps. This included defining schedules, contract structures, legal considerations, and market allocation. Additionally, the work package outlined the requirements for the pilot application and ensured its alignment with customer needs.

### WP6: Review and Way Forward

The final work package involved reviewing the pilot application and proposing the way forward based on the work conducted in previous work packages. This included considerations for financing, the development of a business plan, and other relevant factors for the successful continuation of the digital twin journey.

## Project Schedule

To ensure an organized and efficient exploration phase, a project schedule was established. The schedule outlined the timeline for each work package and key milestones. Here is an overview of the project schedule:

- **WP0: Project Management**: This work package focused on managing the project team, reporting to stakeholders, and maintaining communication with customers and internal ABB management.
- **WP2: Establish and Qualify Business Case**: This work package consisted of two steps. Step 1 had a duration of 7-8 weeks, starting from August to September. Step 2 had a duration of 4 weeks, happening in October.
- **WP3: Competence Gaps and Requirements**: This work package had a duration of 8 weeks, starting in September and ending in November.
- **WP4: Customer Case**: This work package also had a duration of 8 weeks, starting in September and ending in November.
- **WP1: Hackathon**: The hackathon work package was conducted throughout the exploration phase, with the purpose of gathering internal ideas and use cases within the digital twin domain.

## Proposed Next Steps

After the completion of the exploration phase, several key discussions and activities were proposed for the next steps of the digital twin journey. These included:

1. Agreeing on a common goal for the exploration phase, including expectations and content.
2. Allocating a project manager and proceeding with the project description of roles, responsibilities, and the plan for execution.
3. Obtaining anchoring and approval from senior stakeholders to ensure support and commitment to the journey.
4. Setting the plan in motion and implementing proper follow-up mechanisms to track progress and address any challenges that may arise.

## Resources and Funding

The exploration phase required sufficient resources and funding to carry out the planned activities. A total of 3 FTE's (Full-Time Equivalents) were allocated for a period of 2 months, with a budget of 2 MNOK (Million Norwegian Krone). This allocation aimed to ensure the availability of skilled personnel and financial support to successfully execute the exploration phase.

## Conclusion

The exploration phase of the digital twin journey plays a crucial role in establishing and qualifying the business case for digital twin implementation. By conducting in-depth market analysis, engaging with customers, and addressing competence gaps, this phase lays the foundation for the subsequent phases of the journey. With the proposed next steps and adequate resources, the digital twin journey is poised to advance towards the customer pilot application phase, bringing forth the value proposition of digital twin technology.
