ABB: Partner for the journey ahead
Sustainability, electrification and digitalization are the mandates of greatest
urgency for process industries today. On the one hand, they must find ways
to maintain efficient production of life’s necessities while reducing the
impact of their operations on the environment. On the other, it is widely
acknowledged that only through the thorough application of new and
emerging digital technologies can such advances be realized.
These mandates require that the rigid, monolithic ABB has set a target to support customers in

Deep, wide, industry domain expertise
Building on rich domain expertise in many pro-
cess industry verticals, ABB is uniquely equipped
to help these industries address future challenges.
This expertise spans the globe, and begins with
front-end engineering and design, continues with
project execution and on through the services
needed over the plant life. ABB works with its
customers to solve industry-specific challenges
through delivery of application-specific automa-
tion expertise.
In addition to being a noted global provider of
electrification and automation, ABB is a significant
systems integrator that brings together compo-
nents and subsystems from a broad range of
solution providers. Through collaboration with a
selected network of partners, ABB takes multi-
scope responsibility and delivers a comprehensive
integrated solution for process automation,
electrical control, safety, telecommunications, and
digital applications.
For large capital projects, ABB Adaptive
Execution™ integrates expert teams, new
technologies, agile processes, shared learnings,
and proven methodologies into a single, stream-
lined project execution experience for all
