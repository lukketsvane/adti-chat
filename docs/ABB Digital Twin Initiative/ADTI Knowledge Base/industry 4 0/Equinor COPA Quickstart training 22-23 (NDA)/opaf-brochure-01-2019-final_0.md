Small investment, BIG return in
security, flexibility, and profitability
Make multi-vendor work for you!
The Open Process Automation™
Forum is delivering a standards-based,
open, secure, and interoperable
process control architecture through
the collaboration of global leaders
in process industries, system
integrators, suppliers, integrated
DCS vendors, academia, and
other standards organizations.

Become a Member
Experts from both the customer and supplier sides of industry (end users, system
integrators, suppliers), government, academia, and other standards organizations
are invited to join the Forum. The Open Process Automation Forum provides a
vendor-neutral environment for the development of industry standards and accreditation
programs, utilizing the global reach of The Open Group to build awareness, recognition,
and adoption.

Open Systems Architecture Vision
A System of Systems
“We already have communication standards for the field devices. Now, we are
working on The Open Group Standard for modular DSC/SCADA systems, with
components made by different vendors, upgradable for decades, and cyber
secured by design! FINALLY!”
