Kognitwin Dynamic Digital Twin
• Digital twins in their simplest form visualize assets and
processes in 3D and 2D
• … adding asset data enables a single source for asset
information, promoting efficiency and collaboration
• … adding real-time data provides live performance
insights
• … combining data-driven models with physics-based
models and simulation (Hybrid ML) unlocks even more
improved performance
• ... over time this drives towardhigher performance,
automation of complex decisions and higher degrees of
autonomy

Engineering Data (e.g.P&ID’s)
• Brings data together from siloed enterprise systems
and data sources 2D & 3D models
• Materially shortens time searching for and structuring
information
Work processes (from for ex. SAP)
• Enables efficient modelling, app development and
analysis
Time-series data (e.g. real time)
• Performs data verification and validation at a cross-
system, cross-functional level accelerates trouble
shooting and improves data quality

“The Digital Twin provides a more efficient and safer work preparation process, easier
Planning
communication across teams and disciplines, reduction of meetings, faster ways to locate
equipment in heights, less data cross-checks between applications and less logistics and
time spent on field inspections. We can now both communicate and make decisions on the
exact same and unified data foundation”, Discipline Engineer Mechanical in Operations

OPTIMIZE
“The Dynamic Digital Twin allows us to explore the operating envelope both under stable
operation and in transitions between one operations scenario to the next. This opens up for
a completely new way of performing optimization, where the ultimate objective is to
maximize production and minimize energy consumption, while reducing maintenance need
and avoid breakdown of equipment”, Process Engineer in Operations.
