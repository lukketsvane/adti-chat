THE ASSET ADMINISTRATION SHELL: IMPLEMENTING
DIGITAL TWINS FOR USE IN INDUSTRIE 4.0
Making Industrie 4.0 components interoperable
Many companies want to invest in digital solutions and develop new business models. However, they don’t know which
solution they should invest in as this solution needs to be compatible with the systems used by its customers, partners
and suppliers. The use of Industrie 4.0 solutions requires interoperability so that components, devices and applications
can communicate seamlessly across companies, industries and countries. This is where the Asset Administration Shell
comes in. It provides the basis for the development and use of unified and open Industrie 4.0 standards.
The Asset Administration Shell helps implement digital
twins for Industrie 4.0 and create interoperability across The Asset Administration

In the world of Industrie 4.0, each asset1 is given an Asset Adminis­
tration Shell (AAS). The AAS consists of a number of submodels
in which all the information and functionalities of a given asset –
including its features, characteristics, properties, status, parameters,
measurement data and capabilities – are described. It allows for
the use of different communication channels and applications
and serves as the link between I4.0 objects and the connected,
