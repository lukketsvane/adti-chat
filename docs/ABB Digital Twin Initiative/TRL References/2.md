Exit Criteria: Documented description of  
the application/concept that  
addresses feasibility and  
benefit.
Beskrivelse av oppnådd TRL: Teknologikonsept er definert
Definition: Technology concept and/or application  
formulated.
Definition of Technology Readiness Level: Application concept formulated (algorithm)
Description: Invention has begun. Basic individual algorithms or functions are prototyped and documented. Results are speculative and there is no proof or detailed analysis to support assumptions or expectations. Examples are still limited to paper studies.
Hardware Description: Invention begins, practical application is  
identified but is speculative, no  
experimental proof or detailed analysis is  
available to support the conjecture.
Software Description: Practical application is identified but is speculative, no  
experimental proof or detailed analysis is available to  
support the conjecture. Basic properties of algorithms,  
representations and concepts defined. Basic principles  
coded. Experiments performed with synthetic data.
Typisk dokumentasjon ved oppnådd TRL: Det er gjennomført analytiske studier av teknologien, der man vurderer mulige anvendelser. Plan for eksperimentering på TRL3 foreligger.
