# 7

Exit Criteria: Documented test  
performance demonstrating  
agreement with analytical  
predictions.
Beskrivelse av oppnådd TRL: Fullskala prototype eller demonstrasjonsanlegg i markedsrelevant skala er testet ut under reelle driftsbetingelser. 
Definition: System prototype demonstration in an  
operational  
environment.
Definition of Technology Readiness Level: Prototype demonstrated (product RELEASE)
Description: Represents a major step up from TRL 6, requiring the demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment, such as in a command post or air/ground vehicle. Algorithms run on processor of the operational environment are integrated with actual external entities. Software support structure is in place. Software releases are in distinct versions. Frequency and severity of software deficiency reports do not significantly degrade functionality or performance. Verification and Validation is completed, validity of solution is confirmed within intended application. Requirements specification validated by the users. Engineering support and maintenance organization, including helpdesk, are in place.
Hardware Description: A high fidelity engineering unit that  
adequately addresses all critical scaling  
issues is built and operated in a relevant  
environment to demonstrate performance  
in the actual operational environment and  
platform (ground, airborne, or space).
Software Description: Prototype software exists having all key functionality  
available for demonstration and test. Well integrated with  
operational hardware/software systems demonstrating  
operational feasibility. Most software bugs removed.  
Limited documentation available.
Typisk dokumentasjon ved oppnådd TRL: Det foreligger testresultater fra utprøving av prototype systemløsning i reell/markedsrelevant skala under reelle driftsbetingelser. Evaluering av risikoprofil. Beskrivelse av testomfang, utførte valideringsaktiviteter, plan for oppnå TRL8, etc.
