# 5 Steps to Get Started with Digital Twins

## **1. Identify a Use Case**

The first step on your journey with digital twins is to answer the questions: Why do you need a digital twin? What problems could a digital twin address for your organization?

To determine this, engage in discussions that will surface opportunities worth exploring. This could be anything from highly manual, disconnected, and inefficient operational processes, such as a section of the production line that frequently goes down, to optimizing the layout of retail stores and warehouses.

Having identified potential opportunities, the next step is to prioritize a single use case based on potential value, success criteria, and timelines. This use case should align with the business strategy and deliver quick wins with enough impact to secure executive support and necessary resources.

Defining what success looks like and how it will be measured is critical. Your initial use case should be supported by readily available data and a good understanding of the processes and environments to be modeled. A clear execution plan with specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound goals and milestones is necessary.

## **2. Evaluate Data and Environment**

Digital twins rely heavily on access to the right data. As such, an essential early consideration is whether your target use case can be tackled with available data, starting with 3D models or point cloud scans.

Before diving into data collection, it is essential to establish a clear data strategy. Identify key stakeholders in the organization who have an end-to-end understanding of the relevant data, processes, and environments. These individuals can help determine the necessary data and whether it's readily available, accessible, and in a usable format.

## **3. Build a Team**

Constructing a team with the right roles and skills is crucial for a successful digital twin initiative. This team will likely include individuals from your internal technology, engineering, data science, and line of business organizations, as well as extended resources from systems integrators and software development and delivery partners.

When building your first digital twin team, develop a resourcing strategy and identify your existing talent pool. The team might include technical 3D artists, industrial designers, mechanical engineers, engine/tooling/software engineers and developers, simulation engineers, ML engineers, robotics engineers, DevOps/IT engineers, UI/UX developers, and planners and managers.

## **4. Start Small**

Starting with a small scope for your digital twin initiative can help to mitigate the risk of scaling too quickly. Small projects provide lower-risk environments in which teams can quickly test, learn, and iterate. They also allow teams to build momentum quickly, demonstrate organizational impact, and secure the buy-in and resources needed to scale to larger digital twin programs.

# **05: Measure and Communicate Impact**

Digital twins have the potential to be highly transformative for organizations, allowing them to unlock significant operational efficiencies and improve and speed up decision-making. The key to scaling these efforts is measuring and communicating the impact of your proof-of-concept project, tying outcomes back to the original problem statement and the goals and outcomes it addresses. Also, documenting and sharing best practices, lessons learned, and potential barriers can guide future digital twin initiatives and increase their speed.

# **The Big Picture**

In your digital twin journey, it's important to keep aligning your plans to these five steps. Doing so will enable you to unlock the vast potential of digital twins for your organization. Also, keep investing in your purpose, people, and process and make use of digital twin resources available.

# **Building Digital Twins With NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise**

Developing digital twins starts with aggregating the 3D datasets you identified in step two. NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise is a platform that allows you to build and operate metaverse applications like simulations of large-scale, physically accurate virtual worlds and industrial digital twins. This platform helps you achieve full-fidelity visualization of your 3D datasets, develop custom tools to enhance your digital twin initiatives, introduce and apply physics simulation to your 3D models, connect your digital twin to robotic models, and finally, connect your 3D models to their real-world counterparts.

# **Resources to Get Started**

There are various resources to help you get started with building digital twins. You can find inspiration from other companies transforming their industries with digital twins, learn from on-demand sessions, read about specific tools and extensions, and even try a free hands-on lab on NVIDIA LaunchPad. For further help, you can contact NVIDIA's team to discuss how their solutions and partner ecosystem can help you get started with digital twins.

## **SUMMARY:**

Getting started with digital twins involves a series of strategic steps starting with identifying a suitable use case that aligns with business objectives. Evaluating data and building a team with a wide range of skills is crucial. Beginning with a small, manageable scope for the initiative allows for easier testing, learning, and iteration, reducing the risk and building momentum towards larger digital twin programs.
