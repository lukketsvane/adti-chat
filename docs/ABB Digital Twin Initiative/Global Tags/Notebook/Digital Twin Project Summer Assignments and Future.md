Created: June 23, 2023 3:30 PM

## **Key Highlights**

- The project lead will be on vacation, potentially until early August.
- Kalle S. Kalelic is now in charge of the project and will be the main contact during the summer.
- The project's next phase, involving a digital twin, is expected to start in August.
- Pending tasks have been listed should there be time and resources available to work on them.

## **Detailed Information**

Linnea Espevik, will be going on vacation starting next week and is expected to be back by the end of July. Her vacation could extend until August 7th, depending on the weather conditions. During her absence, she will not have frequent access to mail or her PC, but she will remain reachable via phone and email from July 31st onwards.

The status of the digital twin project is also covered. The project is planned to commence in early August with team members including Linnea, Iver, HÃ¥kon Berg (or another member), and a project manager yet to be assigned.

Kalle S. Kalelic, who reports to Katrine Hilmen, the new solutions manager, is now in charge of the project. Kalle will handle project-related duties and inquiries during the summer.

## **Summer Tasks**

If you don't have other tasks assigned, Linnea has suggested some tasks that you could start with:

1. **Summarize the Metaverse Summit Conference**: This summary should be visual and be added to the webpage you have been working on.
2. **Find Conferences/Seminars/Courses**: Identify what we need to know more about and possibly build networks for.
3. **Define the needs of the Digital Twin project's Innovation Lab**: What kind of equipment would be needed, particularly in terms of computer hardware, to support digital twin and visualization tasks?
4. **Consider Network Setup**: Look at how we could set up a secure, independent network outside of ABB.
5. **Continue Working on the CTR Catalog Tasks for the Digital Twin**: Refer to the attached Excel file for detailed tasks.

## **Visualization Tasks**

There are also a set of tasks focused on visualizing various aspects of our project. These include:

1. Visualizing knowledge: How can we make a knowledge database fun and educational?
2. Differentiating between a digital model, shadow, and twin: How can we visualize these differences?
3. Visualizing different layers/levels/parts of a digital twin.
4. Mapping current ABB software/applications: Reach out to Erling Tyse to obtain a list of ABB's digital offerings and see where they fit in the digital landscape.
5. Visualizing offshore wind: If the correct input is provided, start visualizing in accordance with our previous discussions and map the workflow of this process.
