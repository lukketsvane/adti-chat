### **What Is ADTI?**

ADTI, or the ABB Digital-Twin Initiative, is an internal wiki or online database used to centralize information about ABB's Digital Twin initiatives. This database is considered the single source of truth for capturing, organizing, and sharing knowledge internally. ADTI allows every team member to access, create, or edit content about important processes, values, and policies related to our digital twin technology.

The wiki is structured in a tree-like hierarchy, ensuring easy navigation and efficient searchability. It's an interactive platform that's flexible and adaptable, fostering a culture of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and unified workspaces.

### **Purpose**

The purpose of ADTI is to streamline the storing, retrieving, and sharing of knowledge related to our Digital Twin initiatives. It brings together various resources under a unified interface, facilitating easier access to information and improving overall productivity within the organization.

### **Executive Summary**

The ABB Wiki-Twin Initiative (ADTI) centralizes our knowledge base, focusing on Digital Twins. This initiative offers an interactive and user-friendly interface, with features such as real-time collaboration, content editing, and search functionality. It integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Teams, providing a unified workspace for ABB's exclusive use of Microsoft. The wiki enables a streamlined access to content with options to download documents as PDF, SVG, PNG formats, offering flexibility in content consumption.

## **File Structure / Information Handling**

ADTI uses advanced techniques to order and store information efficiently, enabling users to navigate, search, and edit content easily. The wiki operates using a hierarchical system, with documents, articles, and backlogs organized in a tree-like structure. This structure makes it easier for users to understand the relational context between different pieces of information and navigate through the knowledge base smoothly.

The tree-like structure comprises various levels, each representing a different level of detail or a specific category of knowledge. At the top, you have broad categories which drill down to more specific topics as you navigate deeper into the hierarchy. This layered approach allows users to zoom in on the required detail level, reducing information overload and improving overall user experience.

### **Explanation of Returned Taxonomy and its Value**

The returned taxonomy from ADTI presents a hierarchical structure that displays knowledge at varying levels of granularity. Each level in the taxonomy represents a different level of detail, with higher levels providing broad summaries and lower levels offering more specific details. This structure enables users to efficiently explore and comprehend large volumes of data.

The value and usefulness of the returned taxonomy lie in its ability to:

### Simplify Navigation:

The hierarchical structure enables users to navigate the knowledge base in an organized and logical manner. Users can start from top levels, which provide an overview of the main categories, and delve deeper into more specific topics as needed.

### Improve Searchability:

With the taxonomy, users can swiftly find relevant information based on their queries. The system identifies the most pertinent nodes in the taxonomy and returns a list of associated summaries, enabling users to pinpoint desired information without sifting through countless unrelated documents.

### Enhance Understanding:

Summaries generated at each level of the taxonomy provide concise and coherent representations of the underlying information. This makes it easier for users to grasp the key ideas and context without needing to parse every individual document.

### Facilitate Knowledge Discovery:

The taxonomy helps users discover new insights and connections between different topics or ideas by organizing information into meaningful clusters and summaries. This can lead to a deeper understanding and identification of previously unrecognized patterns or trends.

### Optimize Scalability:

The hierarchical structure of the taxonomy allows ADTI to handle large volumes of data efficiently. As new data are added, the system can quickly integrate them into the existing taxonomy through periodic maintenance, ensuring that the taxonomy remains updated and relevant.
