How businesses can stay relevant
and competitive in today’s new
digital era
Featuring insights by Çağlayan Arkan,
General Manager of Worldwide Manufacturing
& Resources at Microsoft
Executive Summary
Technology is omnipresent, and this access to digital services is playing an increasing role
in everything we do: shaping growth, changing industry landscapes, and providing the
catalyst for new business models, products, services and experiences.
Capitalizing on this phenomenon is the key to innovation and growth. From the rise of connected devices and other “things”
within the Internet of Things (IoT), the growing mounds of data, and the emergence of advanced analytics, machine learning
and artificial intelligence, to augmented reality and the next frontiers, the challenge and opportunity for business leaders is
to harness the ubiquitous, disruptive force of technology to be more agile, fuel efficiency and ultimately shape their destiny.
Digital transformation represents the opportunity for businesses to think and operate like digital companies in the way they
engage their customers, empower their employees, optimize their operations and transform their products.
Companies that are doing this are seeing strong results: reduced overhead, conservation of resources, increased profits, and
optimized operational efficiencies. And organizations mature in their journey with digital transformation generate an
average of $100 million more in additional operating income each year than those who lag behind.1 Yet, only 14 percent of
organizations today say they have completely digitized their business processes² and only five percent of organizations feel
that they have mastered digital to a point of differentiation from their competitors.³
For those businesses that can successfully disrupt and differentiate, the potential is remarkable.
Microsoft provides the solutions, services and roadmap to help you get started today. In this guide, you will
learn actionable insights from one of Microsoft’s top digital strategists, Çağlayan Arkan, General Manager of Worldwide
Manufacturing & Resources, that outline seven steps to help you map your path to digital transformation success.

The digital transformation
opportunity
Digital transformation is upon us, and every industry and every business is part of
it. Change is happening fast and many, if not all, industries will be redefined. This
new era is defined by transformation and disruption. The disruptors will be among
the first digital organizations that define what a “digital enterprise” really looks like.
With this topic top of mind with executives, I hear the same question from nearly
every company I talk to, regardless of size or industry: What does it mean to go
through a digital transformation? What does it take? What is important?

optimize the whole. For the first time ever, large enterprises will be able to optimize
their businesses at global level in a way that was not possible before.
With these thoughts as a back-drop, let me share some of the fundamental
thoughts and observations regarding digital transformation.
Digital transformation: seven steps to succes s / / 3
STEP 1 Leadership matters
Technology is a means, not an end, for transformation. It’s about leaders,
leadership, and people. Technology is accessible to everyone, so that is not where
differentiation happens. Differentiation starts with leadership’s vision for change
and a clear execution strategy as to how to bring the rest of the organization with
the leader. Those leaders need to understand how technology will impact their
businesses; how to really think about a 24x7 connection to all of their products,
customers, assets and people; and how all of this will change the competitive
landscape. They need to realize that being passive is not an option. This is now a
“disrupt or be disrupted world.”

For example, Ecolab has chosen to connect its assets leveraging Microsoft’s Azure
IoT and Cortana Analytics Suite and then link those capabilities to employees that
engage with customers every day, leveraging Dynamics CRM and Office 365. In
Ecolab’s case, service reps ensure their customers are provided with clean water
where and when needed. Microsoft is uniquely positioned to make the newly
acquired business insights from the rich data platform “actionable.”

Drive culture change through effective
STEP 2
change management
As Industry 4.0 suggests, what is going on in the industry today is nothing short of
a revolution. A revolution that requires a culture change across the organization.
This concept of becoming a “digital” enterprise will inform and change how a
company makes decisions; how it engages customers; how it manages its supply
chain; how it innovates, designs, manufactures—and the list goes on. Organizations
need to communicate what their “re-invented core” is about, what their “re-
invented brand” is about, what their new behaviors are, what their new mind-set
needs to be, what the new value proposition is, and how all of these factors will
affect how employees are expected to perform. If that is not taken care of, the

ThyssenKrupp Elevator, as part of its “digital” journey, is paying a lot of attention
to leadership development, change management, leadership awareness regarding
technology. ThyssenKrupp leadership and Microsoft have been engaging and
comparing notes. Microsoft is always prepared to be transparent with its customers
regarding its own transformation and share learnings.

Connect your customers, products, assets
STEP 3
and people
Organizations need to understand that, unlike in the past, the product they are
delivering to customers is now going to be connected 24x7 to their enterprise. This
will enable them to know what is going on with that product in terms of what
features are being used, how the product is performing, and much more. In
addition, organizations can connect to their customers and their customers’
environments 24x7, not limited to the customer systems themselves, but also by
way of social listening or IoT. Add to that, connections to all of the assets in the
manufacturing environment, from the supply chain to the field, as well as
employees themselves. There are connections to all of these things, all at the same
Rolls-Royce: Rolls-Royce and time. This means there is a ton more data to collect, understand, reason over, and
Microsoft collaborate to create get insights from. Therein will lie mind-blowing insights, facts, and clues that, for an
new digital capabilities organization, might not have been available before. This is the new gold mine.
Rolls-Royce has more than 13,000 Those new insights will inform an organization’s next steps and how to take those
engines for commercial aircraft in to action. Also, at that point, organizations will want to do more of the same, in
service around the world, and for terms of having more data, more analytics, and more learnings in order to take
the past 20 years, it has offered more actions. That is how the digital journey will typically start.

engine maintenance services that
help keep aircraft available and
efficient. As the rapidly increasing
volume of data coming from
many different types of aircraft
equipment overtakes the airlines’
ability to analyze and gain insight
from it, Rolls-Royce is using the
Microsoft Azure platform to
fundamentally transform how
it uses data to better serve its
customers.
Through our new strategic partnership, Rolls-Royce is now able to monitor 13,000
jet engines on the move around the globe, at any given time. They can monitor
their movement, their state and health, as well as know their destinations and
take actions if necessary. For example, the new system that we built in partnership
allows Rolls-Royce to know that they can “double-click” on a plane, then the jet
engine, and then all the way down to a part in the engine, where they can have
insight into that part’s condition as well as understand its remaining useful life
and what needs to be done. Then, they can simply click an “action” button on the
dashboard to notify an engineer at the airport when the plane will land and if the
engine needs service, with detailed information including the availability of spare
parts if a replacement is needed. This new system enables Rolls-Royce to provide
a very different service to their airline customers and help influence 70 percent of
the airline’s total operating cost base, including fuel management. With this, Rolls-
Royce has moved from selling jet engines to selling “power by the hour.”
Digital transformation: seven steps to succes s / / 6
STEP 4 Adopt a data culture
Connecting all of the above—including products, customers, assets and people—will generate tremendous amounts of data.
Microsoft’s platform makes it very quick and easy to securely ingest, aggregate, cleanse and store data, as well as mesh that
together with other sources of structured and unstructured data in order to run analytics on it. Our platform is unique in its
ability to reduce engineering dependencies and let data scientists do data science and enable enterprises to get to insights
quickly and easily. One statistic I read argues that 90 percent of the total time that is spent on analytics goes to preparing the
data. Our engineering vision is to make it so easy that our customers will spend 10 percent of what is typical to analyze data
and get to insights more quickly.
We know, from our experience with customers like ThyssenKrupp, Jabil, Rolls-Royce and many others, that there are
unprecedented, mind-blowing insights in that data that can tremendously impact the businesses. Therefore, I will posit that
enterprises need to shift from making decisions based on habit, gut feelings, opinions, or experiences, to making decisions
based on data. We call it adopting a data culture. It is very important in the digital world not only to be data driven, but that
organizations understand what is in their data. And, it’s not just about that data alone; organizations must understand what
third-party data and what other data sources are impacting what they do.
One of our hi-tech manufacturing customers had been facing quality problems and was seeing higher scrap rates in some
locations versus others, costing them millions. It was not until they brought their production data together with weather data
that they were able to realize that significant weather systems such as thunderstorms were impacting the power grid in such
a way that small fluctuations were greatly influencing the highly sensitive manufacturing environment.
STEP 5 Experiment and fail fast
The IT industry has this reputation of long planning and implementation cycles for projects that cost millions of dollars and
last years. To make matters worse, the history also shows a relatively low success rate in terms of those expensive IT projects
delivering the desired outcomes. ERP, CRM, and MES projects are typical examples.
Now, that era is over. Today’s digital era is all about experimenting in monthly, if not weekly, cycles. It is a “fail fast” or “learn
fast” era now. Businesses need to find the use case, get the data, understand what is in that data, get the insights and
intelligence, learn from it, and take action. If it fails, go on to the next cycle and the next use case. If it works, understand how
to expand or repeat it. It is those experimental, short cycles of transformation that are key in the digital era because things
are happening very fast. It is all about either disrupting or adopting early, and not being left behind.
No enterprise or industry is exempt from this. All that said, this does not take away planning or being deliberate on what
opportunities to go after. Gartner suggests to cluster use cases on a grid that projects improvement on customer experiences
and increases on organization’s performance. There may be other means of prioritizing or stack ranking. Yet, the
fundamental point here is that organizations need to start somewhere, start immediately, and leverage the data available to
them.
STEP 6 Think ecosystem and become an enterprise software company
No longer can organizations go it alone as an enterprise. Even those who have partner-centric businesses, like Microsoft, still
need to re-think their partners, eco-system(s), and supply-chain. It is no longer about one-off relationships. It is about re-
making industries, creating new eco-systems, markets, and market-places. Businesses must think holistically. They must think
ecosystem. They must think end-to-end supply chain. Then, disrupt or optimize to that level.
Digital transformation: seven steps to succes s / / 7
To help accelerate a new kind of value proposition in the ecosystem, businesses
may find that they even need to start building a new set of partnerships. And not
just software partners or systems integrators, but they will need to build or leverage
existing ecosystems with new kinds of collaboration already established, such as
industry standards bodies like OPC and others.
Microsoft has partnered with the OPC Foundation on the OPC UA standard
and today tens of millions of devices in the manufacturing environments, plant
floors are ready to ingest data to Azure and also able to receive a signal from the
platform. Microsoft’s extended support for the OPC UA open source software
stack spans its IoT offerings, from local connectivity with Windows devices to cloud
connectivity via the Microsoft Azure platform. Integration with Azure IoT allows
customers to easily send OPC UA telemetry data to the Azure cloud, as well as to
