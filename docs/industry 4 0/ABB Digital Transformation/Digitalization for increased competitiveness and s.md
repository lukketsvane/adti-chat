Uniting the twin transitions - there is no Green
Deal without digital
(cid:127) Digital technologies have the potential
to cut global emissions by a fifth by
1. 

(cid:127) If we are serious about reaching our
climate goals, while driving Europe’s
industrial competitiveness agenda in a
global world, we need to accelerate the
twin – green and digital – transition.
(cid:127) The question is not if we need to
accelerate, but how.

Norway needs a green and digital transition
(cid:127) Through a green industrial lift, our government aims to
create jobs, increase exports and contribute to cutting
greenhouse gas emissions.
(cid:127) However, we can not have a green industrial lift
without investing in digital technologies and
digitalization at the same time.
(cid:127) Digital technologies and digitalization will be very
important to ensure global competitiveness for
Norwegian companies going forward.
(cid:127) Moreover, digital technologies and digitization are a
prerequisite for the green shift.
(cid:127) Norwegian companies must therefore develop
leadership in both sustainability and digitalization.

Digitalization in "Hurdalsplattformen"
The government intends to:
‒ Establish a program for Industry 4.0 in collaboration with
relevant industrial environments, to see digitalization,
automation and competence in the industry in context.
‒ Focus on research centers for business-driven
digitalization which gather expertise from research,
academia and business.

NorthWind: Norwegian Research
Centre on Wind Energy
(cid:127) NorthWind works to turn wind R&D into a
profitable export industry that creates green jobs
and respects nature.
(cid:127) SINTEF, NTNU, NINA, NGI, and UiO are research
partners.
(cid:127) ABB, Aker Offshore Wind, Cognite, DNV, Equinor,
Kongsberg Maritime, and Lundin Energy Norway
are among the industry partners.
(cid:127) Digitalization is an integral part of Northwind -
SINTEF is leading the work package on "Digital Twin
and asset management"

Information technology (IT) and operational
technology (OT) are converging
(cid:127) Industrial ICT systems are typically connected
to enterprise IT systems.
(cid:127) Valuable production data is extracted from
the OT domain and sent to IT domain which
allows for remote monitoring, streamlining of
operations, error correction etc.
(cid:127) Architecture for secure data transfer between
the OT and IT domain is of vital importance
for sharing of industrial data.
(cid:127) Successful implementation of industrial
digitalization and sharing of industrial data
requires deep knowledge of both the OT and
IT domain.

Conclusions
(cid:127) Norway needs to accelerate the twin – green and
digital – transition.
(cid:127) Our government has ambitions for industrial
digitalization.
(cid:127) Deep domain expertise combined with leading
digital expertise gives Norway a competitive edge.
(cid:127) IT and OT are converging, so industrial digitalization
relies on deep knowledge of both the OT and IT
domain.
(cid:127) We need to bridge the gap between the OT and IT
domain experts.
