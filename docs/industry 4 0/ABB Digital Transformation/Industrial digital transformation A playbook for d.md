Data: industrial operation’s most
valuable asset
Information Technology (IT), Engineering Technology (ET) and
Operational Technology (OT) have lived in separate worlds
for decades.
Industrial transformation makes it possible for them to work together seamlessly
Information / Operational
on a common platform and generate accurate key performance indicators (KPIs).
Engineering Technology Technology
In the past, industrial technology management has been split between Top-down support for Monitors and controls

Information Technology (IT), Engineering Technology (ET) and Operational
management & processes
Technology (OT).
In recent years, advances in connectivity, big data, and the expansion of the
industrial internet of things (IIoT) have led to a new breed of intelligent
manufacturing technology.
As IT, ET and OT become more independent, their convergence opens the door to
previously unseen opportunities. Focus is shifting from administrative systems
to a core business imperative to data integration at all levels, for bottom and
top-line growth.
Data-driven opportunities
Integrating the varied data from equipment, processes, plants and business • More agile manufacturing
systems gives business leaders organization-wide visibility and control. • Improved production safety and efficiency
• Remote and mobile operations
Management can quickly evaluate how production is impacted by rising material • Greater operational performance insight
costs, adapt pricing strategies, better manage supply chains and assets.
“ Demand for streamlined and automated data is expected to grow by 19.7%
annually - driven by smart manufacturing platform requirements” (1)

Integrating IT/ET/OT is the starting point for the digital enterprise Revolution Beacons of Technology and Innovation
in Manufacturing, 2019)
Industrial transformation allows data to flow seamlessly between operational and business
systems. This enables new capabilities such as energy, safety, sustainability and process
optimization, predictive maintenance, asset management and data-driven decision making.
A system that effectively leverages data regardless of its source is a key differentiator.
