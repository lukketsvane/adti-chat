What is an Asset Information Model?
Asset information models (AIMs) are software
artefacts that provide a trusted and
harmonised single information source that
enables management of real assets.
AIMs might include:
• asset (or system) breakdowns
• real time data
• simulated data
• product definitions
• technical documentation

What is an Asset Information Model?
Asset Information Models (AIMs) are instrumental for the realisation of Digital Twins.

Technology for a better society
Open issues with Asset Information Models
• No general consensus about how AIMs should be implemented
• No standard representations that facilitate use, exchange and access to AIMs
• AIMs are very expensive to build and maintain
• Not clear how AIMs should be integrated with Digital Twins

Machine interpretable information
• Machine interpretable information is defined using formal languages that machines
can understand (interpret) without human support
• Machine interpretable information is encoded in digital representation artefacts
known as ontologies (aka knowledge graphs)

Ontologies (aka Knowledge Graphs)
An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization.
Studer et al., 1998. Knowledge engineering: Principles and methods.
Ontologies (aka Knowledge Graphs)
Machine interpretable (unambiguous, implicit knowledge can be inferred)
An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization.
Agreed among several people
Abstract and simplified view of the world
Studer et al., 1998. Knowledge engineering: Principles and methods.
Ontologies (aka Knowledge Graphs)
• An ontology is a digital representation artefact that can be interpreted by humans
and machines
• It defines a "digital lingua franca" agreed among several people for information
exchange
• It defines (unambiguously) a collection of terms (including classes, relations and
entities) and restrictions about how to apply these terms
• It is usually encoded using a graph data model
Technology for a better society
W3C (& IETF) standards for building ontologies
STANDARD PURPOSE
Modelling language for the implementation of
ontologies
Query language for retrieving specific content of
ontologies
Graph data model for storing and exchange ontologies
A string of characters that unambiguously identifies a
particular term (e.g. class, relation and individual)

Industry Standards and Recommendations for
machine interpretable (semantic) AIMs
• Many industry standards and recommendations are published as PDF reports
enriched with tabular data (e.g., Excel files)
‒ Not a suitable representation for applying these standards in digitalization initiatives
• Many industry standards and recommendations are developed by different working
groups
‒ Integration between related standards and recommendations are not properly addressed
• Many industry standards must be adapted (extended) to be suitable to build machine
interpretable (semantic) AIMs
• Not a general consensus in the industry about which standards and
recommendations and how to apply them to build machine interpretable (semantic)
AIMs

Towards Semantic Asset Information Models
(SAIMs)
4. Define how to integrate and deploy SAIMs in Digital Twins
3. Define methods and tools for building SAIMs
2. Digitize selected standards and recommendations as ontologies

1. Select, adapt and integrate industry standards and recommendations
