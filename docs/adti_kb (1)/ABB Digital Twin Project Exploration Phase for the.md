## Introduction

ABB is embarking on an exploration phase for the concept of digital twins. This emerging technology, fueled by the key drivers of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT), represents a significant opportunity for ABB to enhance its digital portfolio. With a predicted global compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40% between 2021 and 2026, the digital twin market presents substantial potential for future revenue streams.

This article outlines ABB's approach for this exploration phase of the digital twin journey, detailing its focus on increasing revenue, relevance, and margin. It emphasizes the necessity for understanding the market, customer requirements, potential revenue streams, and optimal timing to leverage the opportunity effectively.

## Digital Twin Exploration Phase Overview

ABB has divided the exploration phase into two main stages: the initial Exploration in 2023 and a subsequent Pilot stage with customers in 2024.

### Exploration Phase (2023)

The exploration phase is business-driven for the HUB NEU, with a funding allocation of 0.2-0.25 MUSD LD NO. The target markets for this phase are the offshore wind market and PtX / H2.

In addition to these target markets, the exploration phase includes several key concepts such as Lean Design and JustEco, contributing to remote operations and control and in-depth knowledge on ABB components, respectively.

### Pilot Phase (2024)

The pilot phase follows the exploration phase, with international funding of 1.4 MUSD allocated for 2024. The goal of this phase is to engage potential customers in workshops to develop viable digital twin applications.

## Work Packages in the Exploration Phase

The exploration phase comprises four work packages, taking place in Q3/Q4 2023, with an estimated cost of 4.5 MNOK (1680 h).

The work packages are as follows:

1. **WP1: Hackathon & Value Proposition**: This work package aims to generate internal ideas and use cases in the digital twin domain from subject matter experts and trainees.
2. **WP2: Establish and Qualify Business Case**: This package involves a thorough market analysis, interviewing peers and customer groups, and reviewing existing digital twin solutions.
3. **WP3: Competence Gaps and Requirements**: This package focuses on creating frameworks for workstreams and data collection. It also explores potential acquisitions and strategic competence acquisitions, either organic or inorganic.
4. **WP4: Customer Case**: This work package involves establishing customer contact and setting a framework for the next steps, including scheduling, organization, contract structures, integrity, legal issues, and market allocation.
5. **WP5: Pilot Application**: In this phase, a pilot application is implemented, showcasing the value proposition in a real-life scenario.

## Project Schedule

The project schedule has been planned meticulously to ensure efficient use of resources and to meet set deadlines. The Hackathon (WP1) and Business Case Development (WP2) will take place concurrently, followed by the Competence Gaps and Requirements Analysis (WP3). Finally, the Customer Case (WP4) will be addressed.

The total estimated duration of the exploration phase, which includes all four work packages, is approximately five months.

## Conclusion

The exploration phase is an essential first step for ABB to become a company of the future and to achieve its sustainability goals. The successful implementation of this phase could significantly expand ABB's digital portfolio and increase its digital twin deliveries. The digital twin journey promises a future of new possibilities and revenue streams, underpinned by the solid foundation of ABB's commitment to innovation and excellence.
