Our Business Objectives for the Digital Twin initiative are centered around three key areas:

1. **Increase Revenue:** By incorporating Digital Twin technology into our offerings, we expect to tap into a rapidly growing market, leading to increased revenue.
2. **Increase Relevance:** Digital Twin technology aligns with Industry 4.0 and the push towards digital transformation across industries. By providing solutions in this area, we will ensure that ABB remains relevant in an increasingly digital world.
3. **Increase Margin:** Digital Twin solutions can be delivered with relatively low incremental costs, leading to high-margin returns.

To achieve these objectives, we have several strategies in place:
