# Publishing on Heroku

### some tasks for the webpage:

- Deploy on Heroku, to do this it is necessary for me to install Heroku, the deployment is free as long as im just using one project.
- to do this i need to get my applications up and running on the workstation as mac only supports heroku **if** you install the >15gb x-code devloper functionality.

##Benefits of making this wiki page:

- all the information is stored in markdown, which makes it easy to i.e. implement automation of processing the information to make proper search functionality, or process the information with the user of vector embeddings to creacte chat-bot functionality and more.
