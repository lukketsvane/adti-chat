## **Business Objectives**

The main goal of the Pilot Phase is to implement a pilot application that demonstrates the practicality and value of the Digital Twin framework in real-world scenarios. The specific objectives for this phase are outlined below:

1. **3D Visualization**: Develop a robust 3D visualization system that is clear and powerful, helping users better understand the digital twin.
2. **Live Data Integration**: Integrate live data from the asset into the application to provide real-time insight and understanding.
3. **Interactivity and Control**: Implement features that allow users to interact with data and have some degree of control over the digital twin.
4. **Connectivity with Existing Portfolio**: Ensure that the application has connectors to the existing ABB portfolio, maintaining consistency and integration.
5. **Live/Simulated Modes**: Create full alignment between live and simulated modes, enhancing the utility and versatility of the digital twin.
6. **Workflow Implementation**: Define and implement specific workflows for managing digital twin assets effectively.
7. **Time Dimension in a 3D World (4D)**: Incorporate a time dimension into the 3D visualization, allowing for temporal analysis and predictions.
8. **Industry Agnostic**: Design the application to be industry-agnostic, allowing it to be utilized across a wide range of industries.
9. **Future Proofing**: Build the application to be scalable and adaptable to future technological advancements and industry requirements.
