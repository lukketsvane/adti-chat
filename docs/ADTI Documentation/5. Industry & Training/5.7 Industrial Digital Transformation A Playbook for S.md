In the modern world where technology advances at an unprecedented pace, businesses often feel the pressure to improve performance. This article provides a structured playbook for scaling digitalization, leveraging practical industry insights.

## **Why Digital Transformation?**

In an era where productivity gains and smart factories drive competitive action, digital transformation is no longer an option - it's a necessity. Key industry trends include:

- An average productivity gain of 12% from smart factories.

- A third of process industries have already made their factories smart, planning to transform an additional 40% over the next five years.
    
    **[2](https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4#user-content-fn-2%5E)**
    
- Predictive analytics has become the number one use case for manufacturing.
    
    **[3](https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4#user-content-fn-3%5E)**
    
- There is an expected increased demand for AI-enabled products and services from 70% of companies.

These statistics illustrate the transformation landscape and why it's important for businesses to seize Industry 4.0 opportunities.

## **Integrating IT, ET, and OT**

Historically, Information Technology (IT), Engineering Technology (ET), and Operational Technology (OT) have existed in separate domains. The advent of digital transformation now allows these entities to work together seamlessly on a common platform, generating accurate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

This convergence of IT, ET, and OT opens doors to new opportunities as businesses shift their focus from administrative systems to data integration at all levels for growth. Integrating data from equipment, processes, plants, and business systems provides organization-wide visibility and control, thus enabling agile manufacturing, improved production safety, efficiency, and greater operational performance insight**[4](https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4#user-content-fn-4%5E)**.

## **The Value of Digital Transformation**

Digital transformation enables data to flow seamlessly between operational and business systems. This fluidity opens up new capabilities such as energy, safety, sustainability, and process optimization, predictive maintenance, asset management, and data-driven decision making.

Businesses that effectively leverage data, regardless of its source, gain a significant competitive edge. Industrial transformation helps achieve a 35% improvement in overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and a 25% reduction in downtime with predictive maintenance**[5](https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4#user-content-fn-5%5E)**.

## **A Framework for Successful Digital Transformation**

To ensure a smooth digital transition, a balance between short and long-term targets is crucial. ABB has developed a three-fold framework to manage this process:

1. Starting a common digital journey and achieving quick wins
2. Implementing digital initiatives and delivering results
3. Building a digital culture and program management for scaling up

This process entails understanding your business's starting point, defining pain points, setting clear objectives, and developing an agile and collaborative approach to realize quick wins[^6^].

## Implementing Digital Initiatives, Delivering Results, and Scaling Up

### Enterprise Digital Architecture

IT/ET/OT integration can pose significant challenges, especially when enterprise information infrastructure includes heterogeneous data and incompatible legacy OT systems. To overcome these hurdles, it is crucial to consider domain-specific expertise and specific connectivity solutions.

Serverless computing enables us to concentrate on data rather than infrastructure. We can store structured, highly relational data and work with unstructured data, with particular focus on time series transactional data crucial in OT systems. This allows us to store, evaluate, and analyze high volume time series data effectively.

### Managing Data Integration

IBM Research estimates that up to 88% of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) data remains unused. The Economist suggests that 99% of the value of manufacturing data is lost, with only 3% tagged and analyzed. As such, identifying the most valuable data on-premise can enhance the overall value that you can extract from it.

With ABB's expertise in IT, ET, and OT infrastructure and domain-specific knowledge, we ensure your data management approach aligns with your business strategy. We understand how to label, model, and structure industry-specific data and how to store, compute, and stream high volumes of data securely and cost-effectively.

### Transformational Use Cases

Digital transformation impacts all facets of your organization, demanding a holistic view of the business landscape, including process optimization, utility, energy, supply chain, logistics, mobile workforce, and health and safety. Leveraging our expertise, we can help you optimize your operations, reduce energy costs, enhance mobile workforce communication, improve environmental safety, enhance production planning, and reduce maintenance costs, among other things.

### Advanced Analytics and Visualization

Analytics and machine learning (ML) play a crucial role in digital transformation, with artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly becoming a major disruptor. Through ABB's end-to-end solutions and services, you can realize immediate benefits and achieve operational performance, energy efficiency, sustainability, safety, improved productivity, quality, and cost savings.

For customers who are not yet ready to invest in developing their own analytics, we provide them with end-to-end analytics solutions adapted to their needs. We also provide continuous remote support. If you have your own expertise and want to self-diagnose problems, our powerful enterprise-grade industrial analytics and AI platform can help you reduce your IT costs.

## Are You Ready for a Game-Changing Partnership?

In this fast-changing, multidirectional, computer-intensive world, let's focus on what matters to people and your business. We believe that technology without purpose will never create sustainable results. Hence, we're committed to encouraging your people to bring their ideas to the table.

Our approach is collaborative, combining our tailored solutions with those of carefully selected partners to provide a broader view and speed to the final solution. We're ready to help you manage the complexity of large digital transformation initiatives, rethink customer experiences, operational and business models, and reduce time to value.

Let's partner and solve problems together.
