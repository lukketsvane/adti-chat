### Summary

This article provides an overview of ABB's digital solutions that aim to optimize operations for the NOA and Krafla fields as part of the NOAKA project. Highlighted solutions include the Digital Twin architecture, advanced applications for production optimization, performance management, and safety and integrity barriers.

### Article

ABB, a global technology company, has prepared a comprehensive selection of its advanced digital solutions, presented in a preliminary document on September 2, 2022. This document is part of a response to an RFI (Request for Information) from DNV on behalf of Aker BP for the upcoming NOAKA field's digitalization.

The digital solutions introduced are designed to address specific operational areas of the NOA and Krafla fields. They are represented in an architecture provided by DNV that emphasizes Digital Twin technology. This architecture includes various functional elements that utilize collected data to enhance operations, such as predictive maintenance, safety and integrity barriers, and production optimization.

ABB's solutions align with this architecture, focusing particularly on the Functional Elements layer, underpinned by the Cognite Data Fusion platform (CDF). However, the offerings in logistics & Visualization/3D-modeling are currently not considered as they don't align with the specific request.

### Production Optimization

ABB's portfolio for production optimization includes [Insight Dashboards](https://new.abb.com/process-automation/genix/genix-apm), [Linea](https://new.abb.com/process-automation/genix/genix-apm), [Event Explorer](https://new.abb.com/process-automation/genix/genix-apm), and [Network Insight](https://new.abb.com/process-automation/genix/genix-apm). These tools utilize Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery methods to provide a sophisticated analysis of various operational aspects. Additionally, the Process Power Simulator (PPSim) is introduced, providing an operational virtual representation of an asset or system for advanced diagnostics and prediction.

### Performance Management

The Asset Performance Management system includes [Genix APM](https://new.abb.com/process-automation/genix/genix-apm), designed to reduce maintenance costs and downtime, supporting condition monitoring and predictive maintenance.

### Safety and Integrity Barriers

For Safety and Integrity barriers, ABB offers [AlarmInsight](https://new.abb.com/process-automation/process-automation-service/advanced-digital-services/alarm-management/alarm-insight), [SafetyInsight](https://new.abb.com/oil-and-gas/products/automation/safety-insight), and a SaaS-based Valve Verification tool. These tools contribute to the reduction of operational risks, improved management of safety systems, and tracking of valve status.

### Energy Management

The [Optimax](https://new.abb.com/power-generation/energy-management/optimax-solution-suite/optimax-for-sites) solution was introduced as a functional element 'X' for the energy management of sites. It enables the optimization of energy selection based on key performance indicators like sustainability, affordability, and cost.

Please note that all these offerings are continuously being improved. Therefore, this snapshot of ABB's digital solutions serves as a foundation for discussions and is non-binding. For further queries, ABB representatives can be contacted.
