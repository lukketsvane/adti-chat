# Embracing Open Process Automation: Unleashing Innovation and Profitability

Last edited time: June 26, 2023 1:08 PM

Today's competitive environment poses a continual challenge for industrial manufacturers. They face pressures to reduce capital and lifecycle costs of their process control systems while enhancing the profitability of their operations. The Open Process Automationâ„¢ Forum offers a novel solution. By fostering a standards-based, open, secure, and interoperable process control architecture, the Forum is redefining how industries operate.

## A Consortium for a Secure, Interoperable Future

The Open Process Automation Forum is a collaborative initiative involving global leaders in process industries, system integrators, suppliers, integrated DCS vendors, academia, and other standards organizations. They aim to design future automation systems that uphold standards of heterogeneity and intrinsic security, while enabling multi-vendor interoperability and facilitating easy systems migration.

Proprietary control systems currently in use pose challenges in integration with best-in-class third-party components and are costly to upgrade and maintain. More critically, they often lack the essential cybersecurity to counter growing threats. Open, interoperable, and secure-by-design process automation systems architectures address these issues, promising greater security, flexibility, and profitability.

## Open Process Automation: Scope and Purpose

The Open Process Automation Forum focuses on various areas in the business and industrial ecosystem, including:

- Control, Lege, and Distributed Control System
- Programmable Logic Controller
- Human-Machine Interface (HMI)
- Safety Instrumented System
- Manufacturing Execution System
- Input/Output System
- System software (runtime, namespace, etc.)
- Application software
- Data model
- Communication Network
- Sensor, Actuator, Plant Hardware (I/O)

## A Structured Approach for a Global Impact

The Forum follows a structured and proven approach, developing technical standards and business practices to implement the open process architecture. By acknowledging key governing principles and associated Quality Attributes, the Forum targets sustainable business models and a balanced ecosystem for all stakeholders.

Key areas of standard implementation include:

- Supporting industry value chains and business models
- Developing a "standard of standards" for interoperability and application portability
- Establishing a conformance program to identify products compliant with technology standards
- Promoting the global adoption of these standards

## Join the Open Process Automation Forum

Industry experts from end users, system integrators, suppliers, academia, and other standards organizations are invited to join the Forum. It offers a vendor-neutral environment for the development of industry standards and accreditation programs, leveraging the global reach of The Open Group to build awareness, recognition, and adoption. Interested parties can join at [www.opengroup.org/open-process-automation/membership](http://www.opengroup.org/open-process-automation/membership).

## Benefits of Open Process Automation

For end users, Open Process Automation increases operational profitability, enables continuous innovation, reduces system integration costs and delays, maintains pervasive and modern security, and reduces the total cost of ownership.

On the supplier side, it expands the top line by reaching new markets and customers, remaining relevant to existing customers, and creating new goods and services for expanded markets. It also grows the bottom line by increasing margins, reducing costs, and eliminating non-differentiated products.
