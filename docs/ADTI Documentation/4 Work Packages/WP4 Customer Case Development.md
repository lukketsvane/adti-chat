## WP4: Customer Case Development

### Overview

Work Package 4 (WP4) is focused on identifying the competency gaps and requirements necessary for the successful implementation of the digital twin strategy within the local PAEN NO division. It will also include exploring potential mergers and acquisitions (M&A) opportunities and designing a framework for ABB's digital twin pilots.

### Budget Details

The budget and resource allocations for WP4 are under review and will be updated as soon as they are confirmed. The work package involves the following resources:

| Category No | Category Name | Resource Name | Resource Category | Hours | Other Cost |
