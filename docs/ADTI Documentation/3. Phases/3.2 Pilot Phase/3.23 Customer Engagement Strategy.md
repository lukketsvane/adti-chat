## **Customer Engagement Strategy**

In the Pilot Phase, a key objective is to actively engage with potential and existing customers. This strategy helps to create value and understand their needs while developing a solution that can effectively address their challenges. The engagement strategy is broken down into several components:

1. **Hackathons (CTR 001)**: Organize hackathons that aim to gather innovative ideas in the Digital Twin domain. These hackathons not only engage the technical teams but also create opportunities for customer involvement.
2. **Market Analysis (CTR 002)**: Perform a thorough market analysis to understand current trends, customer needs, and the competitive landscape. This helps to tailor the offerings more effectively.
3. **Seminars and Courses (CTR 002)**: Attend relevant seminars and courses to continuously learn about emerging trends and technologies. This allows us to ensure that our solutions are always up-to-date and relevant to our customers.
4. **Interviews with Peers (CTR 002)**: Conduct interviews with peers to gain insights about their experiences and learn from their successes and failures.
5. **Customer Case Exploration (CTR 002)**: Explore potential customer cases to understand the specific challenges they are facing and how our solutions can address those needs.
6. **Design Thinking Workshops (CTR 002)**: Organize design thinking workshops that focus on understanding the end goal of the customers. This empathetic approach helps to develop solutions that truly meet the needs of the customers.
7. **Establishing Business Case with Existing Customers (CTR 002)**: Use the information and relationships with existing customers to establish a strong business case for the Digital Twin solutions.
8. **Customer Screening and Contact (CTR 002)**: Screen potential customers to find a good fit for the solutions and approach them through established ABB contacts. This strategy helps to ensure a smooth initial engagement and opens up opportunities for deeper collaborations.
9. **Customer Design Thinking Workshops (CTR 002)**: Conduct specific workshops with customers using design thinking methodologies. These workshops aim to align the solution development process with the customers' needs and challenges.
10. **Presentation of Results (CTR 002)**: Once the solution has been developed and tested, present the results to the customers. This not only keeps them in the loop but also helps to gather their feedback for further improvement.
11. **Visualization and Communication (CTR 003)**: Use effective visualization and communication techniques to demonstrate the Digital Twin concept. This could include examples from relevant industries, such as offshore wind, to show the practical applications of the concept.
