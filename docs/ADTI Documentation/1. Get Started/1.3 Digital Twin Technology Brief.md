- **Digital Model**: This is a representation of a physical entity. It's a static model that doesn't change over time or in response to changes in the physical entity it represents.
- **Digital Shadow**: This is a digital model that is enhanced with real-time data. It reflects the current state of the physical entity it represents, changing as the physical entity changes.
- **Digital Twin**: This is a digital shadow that also includes predictive capabilities. It not only reflects the current state of the physical entity but can also predict future states based on current and historical data.

- **Physical Layer**: This is the physical entity that the digital twin represents. It could be a machine, a building, a vehicle, or any other physical object or system.
- **Data Layer**: This layer consists of the real-time data and historical data associated with the physical entity. This data is used to update the state of the digital twin and to make predictions about the future state of the physical entity.
- **Model Layer**: This layer includes the mathematical models and algorithms used to interpret the data from the data layer and to make predictions. These models and algorithms are often based on physics, statistics, machine learning, or other relevant disciplines.
- **Application Layer**: This is the layer of applications and services that use the digital twin. These applications and services might include monitoring systems, control systems, optimization systems, decision support systems, and so on.
