## WP3: Competence Gaps Identification

### Overview

The third work package (WP3) focuses on identifying the competencies required for 3D visualization and digital twins, as well as scoping potential software tools and resources. The deliverables of this work package will contribute to the understanding of what technical capabilities ABB needs to enhance or acquire to fully exploit the potential of digital twins and 3D visualization.

### Budget Details

The budget allocated for this work package is 394,600 NOK. The resources are divided as follows:

| Category No | Category Name | Resource Name | Resource Category | Hours | Hourly Rate | Total Cost | Other |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Project & Site manager, Resp. eng. lead | Project Manager | Internal rates | 15 | 1,315 NOK | 19,725 NOK | - |
| 4 | Engineer, Purchaser, Project controller | Victoria Stine Kristiansen | Internal rates | 75 | 1,095 NOK | 82,125 NOK | - |
| 4 | Engineer, Purchaser, Project controller | Iver Finne | Internal rates | 140 | 1,095 NOK | 153,300 NOK | 100,000 NOK (Hardware and software licenses) |
| 1 | Specialist | Christian Wiig | Internal rates | 30 | 1,315 NOK | 39,450 NOK | - |

### Objectives

The main objective of WP3 is to visualize and present concepts for internal and external communication within the field of digital twins, 3D models, and large language models.

### Scope of Work

The work package is divided into the following activities:

- Scope potential software tools and resources for 3D visualization (200 hours)
- Spec. Hardware requirements for 3D sandbox environment (90 hours)
- Describe workflow from idea to finalized 3D marketing material (picture, animation, video, interactive environment etc.) (40 hours)
- Gather input from stakeholders (60 hours)
- Identify and gather existing 3D models and work flows within ABB (70 hours)
- Use 3D drawing software to visualize ABB offering within the offshore wind industry (60 hours)

### Input

- List of components / equipment for offshore wind visualization
- Expectations on output and wanted communication form (picture, animation, video, interactive environment etc.)

### Deliverables

- Updated business case
- Market analysis
- Potential business models
- Customer use cases
- Risk and opportunities

The deliverables from WP3 will provide ABB with a clear understanding of the technical requirements and potential applications for 3D visualization and digital twin technology. The package will also produce an actionable plan for upgrading or acquiring the necessary hardware, software, and technical competencies.
