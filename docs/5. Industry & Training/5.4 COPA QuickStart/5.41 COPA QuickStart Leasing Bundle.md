COPA QuickStart Leasing Bundle is an all-inclusive package that has been designed to provide comprehensive training and support in Open Process Automation (OPA). This bundle includes equipment, software, support, maintenance, and training materials to ensure that users can effectively utilize and implement OPA.

## ANNUAL UNIT LEASE

This bundle is available on an annual lease basis. The package includes not only the equipment needed but also the necessary software, continuous support, maintenance services, and extensive training materials. This comprehensive offer is designed to provide the utmost convenience to the users.

## OPA OVERVIEW LECTURERS

The bundle includes two days of lectures, designed to provide an overview of Open Process Automation. The number of students for these lectures is unlimited and includes live demonstrations and a question and answer session. A separate two-hour introductory session is also available for managers and executives to gain a basic understanding of OPA.

## INSTRUCTIONAL LECTURES WITH HANDS-ON LABS

In addition to the OPA overview lectures, the bundle offers 50 hours of deep training that includes hands-on exercises and collaborative discussions. This training is, however, limited to 6 students to ensure focused instruction and effective learning.

## QUICKSTART TRAINING AND HOSTING FACILITY

Phoenix Contact in OSLO serves as the training and hosting facility for the QuickStart Unit. The facility offers both large and small training spaces to accommodate various training needs.

## PATH TO FIELD TRIAL

The QuickStart Leasing Bundle also provides a clear path to a field trial. This journey starts with Scoping and Design Workshops led by CSI. Users will then have a custom field trial unit built on the COPA QuickStart Technology Platform. The process concludes with an exploration and modification phase, where users can explore the addition of new vendor components and configurations.
