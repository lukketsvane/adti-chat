# Total Cost of Ownership in Traditional Industrial Control Systems vs Open Process Automation

The advancement of technology has led to the development of Open Process Automation (OPA) control systems, marking a significant shift from traditional industrial control systems (ICS). Given the considerable interest in understanding the financial implications of this shift, this article breaks down the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) estimation for both types of control systems.

## TCO Model and What-If Calculations

The TCO model sheet is designed to provide a detailed comparison of costs between traditional ICS and OPA control systems. It itemizes the initial and ongoing costs required to install, maintain, and replace the control systems, enabling users to perform "What-If" calculations.

### Initial (Project) Cost

The initial project cost is represented in the model from rows 5 through 15. These costs encompass elements such as hardware, software licenses, project management, and engineering (both in-house and vendor/SI), as well as construction.

### Ongoing Maintenance Cost

Rows 17 to 26 model the ongoing, annual maintenance cost. This aspect of the TCO covers costs associated with hardware maintenance, software licenses, in-house staff, and vendors or contractors.

### Upgrade Replacement Cost

The model outlines the cost of upgrading or replacing the system in rows 33 to 44. These costs include hardware and software licenses, project management, I/O replacement, application rewrites, and HMI rewrites.

## Accounting for Experience Curve with OPA Technology

The TCO model considers two distinct scenarios to account for the experience curve associated with the relatively new OPA technology - "Early OPA" and "Mature OPA". This accounts for the progression of an organization's experience with OPA technology, from early adoption to mature use.

## Economic Life Cycle and Extended TCO

The economic life in years is input in cell C28, and the TCO for the initial installation and one economic life cycle is expressed in row 28. An extended TCO, incorporating the initial cost, the first economic life, the replacement project, and the second economic life, is expressed in row 46.

# SUMMARY:

The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) model offers a detailed comparison between traditional industrial control systems and Open Process Automation control systems. It itemizes initial costs, ongoing maintenance costs, and upgrade replacement costs to enable insightful "What-If" calculations. To account for the experience curve with the relatively new Open Process Automation technology, the model includes scenarios for both "Early OPA" and "Mature OPA". It also considers the economic life cycle and extended TCO for a comprehensive understanding of the cost implications of both control systems.
