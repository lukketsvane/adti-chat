# 5.45 COPA QuickStart training: Part 3 Design

Last edited time: June 26, 2023 3:09 PM

The third part of the first COPA QuickStart Training Session, held in September 2022, focused on design concepts in automation, particularly in relation to the Open Process Automation Standard (O-PAS). The session detailed various aspects of project design, project definition, and system design in automation and compared them with the O-PAS.

### Project Charter

In designing an automation project, the session underscored the importance of carrying out a feasibility study, developing project specifications, identifying stakeholders, performing cost/benefit analysis, developing an automation strategy, conducting technical studies, performing justification analysis, and generating a summary document.

In the O-PAS context, project specifications included aspects such as software/hardware performance specifications, owner's preferences for cost, availability, simplicity, and company standards. The standard allowed more choices and opportunities, offering access to best-in-class solutions. The roles of suppliers and performance criteria were highlighted along with the responsibilities of the System Integrator or Main Automation Contractor.

### Project Definition

Project definition consisted of determining operational strategies, analyzing technical solutions, establishing conceptual details, developing a detailed scope of work, generating a cost estimate, developing a project schedule, and planning procurements.

In the O-PAS perspective, there were opportunities to explore options for technical solutions such as visiting sites with similar situations, interviewing system integrators and suppliers, evaluating products, and building a test bed. It also emphasized the evolution of OPA business ecosystem and technology, including O-PAS conformance certification and registry.

### System Design

System design included aspects like hazard analysis, establishment of guidelines, development of equipment specifications, definition of data structure, definition of network architecture, development of functional description, development of test plan, detailed design, preparation of work packages, and long lead-time procurements.

In the O-PAS framework, data structure was based on the O-PAS Connectivity Framework (OCP) which used OPC UA to define information models, providing a universal language for interoperability among components. Network architecture transitioned from vendor proprietary networks to industry-standard technology, with the adoption of software-defined network technology.

The detailed design benefited from improved reuse and portability, with possible needs for novelty and increased precision in purchase requisitions.
