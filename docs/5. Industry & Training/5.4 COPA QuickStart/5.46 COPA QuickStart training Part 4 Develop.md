# Developing an Open Process Automation (OPA) System: A QuickStart Guide

In this article, we'll review the development phase of an Open Process Automation (OPA) system. The following content was discussed during the COPA QuickStart training session in September 2022. Let's break down the development phase into several key steps.

## 1. Develop the Human-Machine Interface (HMI)

Developing an HMI is crucial to create a user-friendly interface for operators to interact with the automation system.

## 2. Develop the Database and Reporting Functions

The database is the backbone of any automation system. It contains critical information about field devices, wire labels, I/O connections, control system tags, and historian tags. These data elements must be structured and organized effectively for efficient system operation.

## 3. Develop the Control System Configuration and Program

In this step, specific I/O assignments are decided and the OPA system instance is engineered based on the design stage work. This process includes building tags in the system, configuring control applications and alarms, and setting up the historian. The OPC UA (OLE for Process Control Unified Architecture) connections among software components are also configured in this phase.

## 4. Implement the Data Transfer Plan

To ensure efficient data flow, a data transfer plan is implemented. It incorporates the configuration of OPC UA connections to facilitate interoperability among different software components.

## 5. Implement the Cybersecurity and Data Integrity Plan

Given the critical nature of control systems in any operation, a robust cybersecurity and data integrity plan is paramount. This plan ensures the protection of data and prevents unauthorized access to the system.

## 6. Perform a Scope Compliance Review

Before moving to the next phase, a thorough scope compliance review is conducted to ensure that all project specifications are met.

## 7. Factory Acceptance Test

Factory acceptance tests (FAT) are crucial to validate that the system functions as intended before being installed at the site.

## 8. Document and Prepare for Turnover

The last step involves documenting all configurations, test results, and important instructions for the operation and maintenance of the system. These documents are then prepared for turnover to the team responsible for the next phase.

OPA systems, leveraging standards like OPC UA, offer the benefits of openness, interoperability, modularity, and interchangeability. These characteristics contribute to an automation system that is current, flexible, and less risky to modify, leading to significant benefits for the end-user.

## Summary

The development phase of an Open Process Automation (OPA) system involves several steps including developing the HMI, database, control system configuration, implementing data transfer and cybersecurity plans, and conducting a scope compliance review and factory acceptance test. The process leverages OPC UA standards to ensure openness, interoperability, modularity, and interchangeability of the automation system.
