# 5.42 COPA QuickStart Products and Services Equinor

Last edited time: June 26, 2023 3:09 PM

Equinor is set to benefit from the COPA QuickStart initiative, a functional industrial control system constructed on the Open Process Automation Standard (O-PAS™). This system is an integration of hardware and software, created with the primary goal of advancing Equinor’s comprehension and strategic assimilation of control systems founded upon O-PAS.

## Understanding the O-PAS

Open Process Automation (OPA) control systems form an integral part of the Industry 4.0 revolution. They not only pave the way for innovation but also minimize the total cost of ownership. To top it off, these systems are fundamentally cybersecure.

The QuickStart system, complemented with comprehensive training, serves as a cost-efficient test-bed capability for process asset owners. The initiative aims to validate crucial OPA benefits and assist Equinor in grasping the essential technologies, engineering principles, and operational skills for building and managing an OPA control system.

## Key Objectives

The QuickStart Unit has been designed to demonstrate specific core attributes of an OPA system:

1. Interchangeability of DCN compute and IO devices from various suppliers
2. Interoperability of IO, compute, and supervisory applications from different suppliers
3. Portability of control applications to DCN’s from different suppliers
4. Modularity achieved by decoupling the IO devices from the control devices
5. Highly automated, flexible deployment of control applications
6. Simplified, highly automated update and replacement of both hardware and software using industrial orchestration
7. Easy import of engineering information via AutomationML
8. Gateway for non-OPAS conformant control systems

## Training Modules

Equinor will receive training through two main tracks: OPA Overview Lectures and OPA Instructional Lectures. The training spans across approximately two days and is designed for an unlimited number of students. It includes live demonstrations and Q&A sessions, with a two-hour introductory lecture specifically curated for senior managers and executives.

The OPA Instructional Lectures, on the other hand, are split into nine modules focusing on the differences between a traditional control system and an OPA system. Upon completion of the training, students will be equipped to participate in the design of an OPA Field Trial and explore the value-added possibilities that come with OPA.

## Inside the QuickStart Unit

The QuickStart Unit is made up of O-PAS-aligned hardware and software that together form a fully functional control system. It includes major elements like the Process Control Platform, Process Control Application(s), and Advanced Control and Security Applications. Though these products are prototypes, production versions are expected to be available in late 2022 for field trial usage.

In addition, the system exhibits various architectural capabilities, such as software-based redundancy for process applications with no-downtime failover and self-healing, automated software and network installation and configuration, and automated backup of applications, among others.

## Logistics

Instruction will be delivered by subject matter experts from CSI and [CPLANE.ai](http://cplane.ai/), with some instructors potentially being subject matter experts from COPA member companies. The Overview Lectures will be delivered in person, depending on COVID travel restrictions, while Instructional Lectures will be primarily taught virtually.

# SUMMARY

The COPA QuickStart initiative aims to aid Equinor's understanding and strategic integration of control systems based on O-PAS. It offers training and a functional industrial control system that demonstrates crucial attributes of OPA systems, such as interchangeability, interoperability, portability, and modularity, among others. The QuickStart Unit, designed for training and experimentation, comprises O-PAS-aligned hardware and software. Along with this,
