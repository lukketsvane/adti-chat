# 5.44 COPA QuickStart training: Part 2 Concepts

Last edited time: June 26, 2023 3:09 PM

In September 2022, an instructional lecture on QuickStart took place. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the major concepts discussed in the second part of the first session. These concepts fundamentally revolve around the Open Process Automation Standard (O-PAS) and cover its principles, benefits, architecture, and more.

### Fundamental Concepts

O-PAS is a result of an integrated business and technical strategy aimed at obtaining and maintaining competitive and affordable control systems throughout their lifecycle. This strategy encapsulates both technical and business aspects.

**Technical Architecture**: It includes modular, loosely coupled, and cohesive structures, with interfaces defined by open standards and verified for conformance.

**Business Model**: In the O-PAS business model, modules can be contested and acquired from independent suppliers. It offers customers the ability to add, modify, replace, or remove components across the system lifecycle.

### Benefits of O-PAS

The implementation of O-PAS presents numerous benefits including:

- **Enhanced Competition**: The open competition of modular components is possible.
- **Interoperability**: The separation of software and hardware modules that can be changed independently is enabled.
- **Cost Savings**: By reusing customer software and components from any supplier across the system lifecycle, cost savings are enabled.
- **Technology Refresh**: Adding capabilities or replacing modules without changing all components of the system is facilitated.
- **Innovation Incorporation**: O-PAS provides the flexibility to reconfigure or add components to meet changing operational requirements and evolving cybersecurity threats.

### Guiding Principles of O-PAS

The O-PAS standard is constructed on several guiding principles, including:

1. Supplier-agnosticism
2. Protection of Intellectual Property (IP)
3. Extensibility and evolvability
4. Utilization of established industry processes and standards
5. Industrial segment-agnosticism
6. Processing environment-agnosticism
7. Defined interfaces for O-PAS components

A detailed exploration of these principles can be found in the [O-PAS Business Guide 2.0](https://publications.opengroup.org/g182).

### Quality Attributes of O-PAS

The quality attributes that underline the O-PAS standard include Safety, Reliability, Securability, Modularity, Interoperability, Availability, Interchangeability, Manageability, Portability, Reusability, Usability, and Scalability.

### O-PAS Architecture Elements

The reference architecture of O-PAS includes Distributed Control Node (DCN), DCN - IO (O-PAS IO Node), DCN - Compute, DCN – Compute + IO, DCN – Gateway, OPAS Connectivity Framework (OCF), and Advanced Computing Platform (ACP).

### Key Technologies in O-PAS Standard

The O-PAS standard and key technologies reference numerous subject matters such as OPC UA, Cybersecurity, Industry standard programming languages, Systems management, Systems orchestration, and others.

### O-PAS Business Ecosystem

The O-PAS business ecosystem incorporates different roles that a company can play. The system integrator is held accountable for system performance.

### O-PAS Conformance Certification Process

The O-PAS Certification Policy was published in February 2022, outlining a certification lifecycle that includes Verification, Certification, and Registry steps.

More details on the certification process can be found in the [O-PAS Certification Policy](https://publications.opengroup.org/x201) and the [O-PAS Certification Guide](https://publications.opengroup.org/x21a).

## SUMMARY

The second part of the first COPA QuickStart Training Session, held in September 2022, expanded on fundamental concepts of the Open Process Automation Standard (O-PAS). The session highlighted the guiding principles, benefits, architecture, and key technologies in the O-PAS standard. Furthermore, the business model, the O-PAS business ecosystem, and the conformance certification process were also outlined.
